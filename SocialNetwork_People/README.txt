Really Old Shitty Project done from scratch to learn programming and some infosec.
It doesn't use any library, is done from ground up and has a lot of bad code practicing, but it's ok to learn some fundamentals.

Is a social network that has all base functionality of a Social Network and has also an "easter egg" page where it shows some present vulnerabilities and how to exploit them.
